NanoDiffVision is a research project in Deep Learning aimed at re-implementing the Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch while exploring and comparing two attention mechanisms: the classic Self-Attention and Differential Attention (introduced in the DIFF Transformer paper). By integrating these advancements, the project envisions Differential Attention as a potential natural evolution of Transformers, offering a more efficient and focused mechanism for attention. The project focuses on compact models, making the approach accessible and efficient even with limited resources.

## üìö Background

Transformers have revolutionized the field of computer vision. NanoDiffVision focuses on re-implementing the Vision Transformer (ViT) while evaluating Differential Attention, a recent mechanism designed to reduce attention noise and focus more on relevant information. The project builds on the insights from the Vision Transformer paper ["An Image is Worth 16x16 Words"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) and the [Differential Transformer paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05258), which introduces the Differential Attention mechanism.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Reproduce the Vision Transformer (ViT)** from scratch to better understand its components.
- **Integrate and compare** classic Self-Attention with Differential Attention.
- **Analyze the performance** of compact models, especially in terms of their ability to handle relevant information while limiting noise.

### Conclusion

The results emphasize the potential of Differential Attention as a lightweight yet highly effective alternative to traditional Self-Attention mechanisms. With significantly fewer parameters compared to ViTBalanced, ViTDiff achieves comparable if not better performance across all evaluated metrics. This highlights its promise as a transformative approach in vision tasks, especially in resource-constrained environments.
